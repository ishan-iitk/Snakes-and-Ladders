# Assignement 1

This **Python** program takes some data as a string input. It then tries to find a positive number x (nonce value) such that when x is appended to the end of the string, the *SHA256* hash of this new string is less than the target, which is

> **0x00000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF**

It also prints the time it takes to get this nonce value.
